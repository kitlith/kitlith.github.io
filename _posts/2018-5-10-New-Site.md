title: New site setup!
---

Well, I setup github pages with my domain finally.

My VPS is currently kinda broken, and I haven't gotten around to fixing it yet,
so I decide to make a whole new setup???

I'm kinda moving away from self-hosting a bunch of services on a VPS to
composing available free services together. Less effort and time required.
I'll probably still run ZNC on my VPS for now at the very least.

I'm probably going to continue slowly customizing this over time.
Hey, maybe sometime I'll even get around to using this newly setup blog!
